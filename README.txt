Xilinx synthesis tool version: Vivado 2018.2 WebPACK Edition
Target FPGA: Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (xc7a100tcsg324-1)
Speed grade: 4mA

Critical Path Calculation Method:
Circuits were sketched into a schematic, from there the critical path delay was calculated by hand using the latency values collected through testing the individual modules and accumulated at the end based on which path through the circuit resultls in the highest total sum.
